# Ika Network (dWallet)

Decentralized MPC signing network built on Sui. dWallets provide zero-trust multi-chain signing via 2PC-MPC protocol.

## Collaboration Style

Act as a critical intellectual sparring partner, not a yes-man. Evaluate every idea on its merits—the user is a collaborator who can be wrong, not an authority to defer to. Question assumptions, point out flaws, logical errors, unstated premises, and potential bugs immediately and directly. Be skeptical by default; each claim must prove itself. No opening praise or "you're right" unless genuinely warranted after scrutiny. Prioritize truth over harmony. Be ruthless with constructive criticism.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Rust - always use release mode for crypto code (debug is far too slow)
cargo build --release
cargo test --release
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# TypeScript SDK
cd sdk/typescript && pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm test                    # Run tests
pnpm lint                    # Lint check

# Move contracts (requires sui CLI)
cd contracts/ika && sui move build
cd contracts/ika_system && sui move build
cd contracts/ika_dwallet_2pc_mpc && sui move build

# Full monorepo
pnpm install                 # Install all JS dependencies
pnpm lint                    # Lint entire monorepo
pnpm prettier:check          # Check formatting
```

## Key Files

- `crates/ika-core/src/dwallet_mpc/` - Main MPC implementation
- `crates/ika-core/src/sui_connector/` - Sui event handling
- `contracts/ika_dwallet_2pc_mpc/sources/coordinator.move` - On-chain MPC coordination
- `sdk/typescript/src/` - TypeScript SDK source

## Dependencies

- Use workspace-level dependencies exclusively
- Define dependencies in root `Cargo.toml`, reference with `{ workspace = true }` in crate `Cargo.toml`

## Code Style

### Rust

**DO:**

- Rust 1.93 toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`), rustfmt 2024 edition
- Prefer functional style; use iterators, `map`, `filter`, `fold` over loops
- Shadow variables when transforming and old value won't be used (keep naming simple)
- Put imports at file top (e.g., `use std::collections::HashSet;`)
- Use English words for numbers in names (`first_item`, `second_part`)
- Module structure: `xxx.rs` as module file with `mod tests` inside
- For all-public structs, prefer direct instantiation over `new()` for clarity
- Malicious parties: use `HashSet`, or if `Vec` call `deduplicate_and_sort()`
- Use `tracing::*` macros for logging
- When moving code between files, copy-paste identically (easier to review)

**DON'T:**

- **NEVER use `unsafe`** - no exceptions
- Don't use mutable variables unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use fully-qualified paths inline in code (use `HashSet` after importing, not `std::collections::HashSet`)
- Don't place imports or function definitions inside functions
- Don't use numbers in names (`x1` → `first_x`, `part2` → `second_part`, `item3` → `third_item`)
- Don't create separate `mod.rs` or `tests.rs` files
- Don't mix public and private data in a struct (unless return-only and immediately destructured)
- Don't use `log::*` macros (use `tracing::*`)
- Don't use unbounded channels (use bounded)
- Don't use `futures::executor::block_on` (use tokio runtime)
- Don't use `bincode::deserialize_from` (use `bincode::deserialize`)
- Don't exceed 20 function arguments (clippy enforced)

### Move

- Use `sui move build` for compilation
- Format with `pnpm prettier:fix-move`

## Testing

```bash
# Rust tests - MUST use release mode for crypto
cargo test --release
cargo test --release -p ika-core           # Single crate
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1   # Sequential execution

# Integration tests
cargo test --release -p ika-core dwallet_mpc::integration_tests

# TypeScript SDK tests
cd sdk/typescript && pnpm test
```

## Cryptography Notes

- 2PC-MPC: Two-party computation where one party is emulated by n-party MPC
- Uses class groups for threshold cryptography
- External crypto dependencies from `dwallet-labs/cryptography-private`
- Curves: secp256k1 (k256), P-256 (p256), ed25519

## When to Stop and Ask

**IMPORTANT:** When given a task with a specific approach, follow that approach. If you encounter issues:

1. **Don't pivot to a different solution** - Ask first
2. **Don't assume the requested approach won't work** - It likely can and should be done that way
3. **Don't waste time implementing an alternative** - You'll just have to redo it

**Stop and consult the user when:**

- The specified approach hits an unexpected obstacle
- You're tempted to "simplify" by doing something different
- You think there's a "better" way than what was requested
- You're about to make architectural changes not explicitly requested

**Trust the user's direction.** If you don't know how to do it the requested way - ASK, don't improvise.

## Git Workflow

**DO:**

- Run `cargo fmt --all` before any commit, and include all formatted files in the commit
- Always work on dedicated feature/fix branches
- Commit and push after each completed task
- Fix any hook issues before committing
- For PR fixes: checkout the PR branch, fix comments, push to that branch

**DON'T:**

- Don't push/commit to `main`, `master`, or `dev` branches
- Don't use `--no-verify` to skip git hooks

## Gotchas

- **Release mode required**: Crypto operations are extremely slow in debug mode
- **Forked from Sui**: Much code structure mirrors Sui Network patterns
- **Sui dependency pinned**: Uses `mainnet-v1.51.5` tag for all Sui dependencies
- **WASM excluded**: `sdk/ika-wasm` is excluded from workspace (separate build)
- **Mysticeti consensus**: Uses Sui's Mysticeti for MPC message routing
